IMPLEMENTED FEEDBACK:

In part 1 you mentioned that i did not comment my code and that there was no sorting/swapping algorithm or method. After looking at my feedback, i have implemented a sorting and partinoning alogorithm in my part 1 function code. I have also commented much more on what certain objects do and the purpose of certain lines of code.
